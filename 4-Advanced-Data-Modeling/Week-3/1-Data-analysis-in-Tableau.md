Introduction
In this exercise you need to perform data analysis in Tableau to help Global Super Store understand their business. Use Tableau Desktop to complete this exercise.

The Global Super Store dataset is attached for you to download and use in this exercise. This file includes more than 51000 records of data about customers, orders and products.

Create a new calculated field called Warranty based on 90 days from the order date. The warranty calculated field should be set as shown below in the following screenshot.


Scenario
Global Super Store have collected large amounts of data. They now need to analyze this data to help understand their business activities and maximize their profits.


Instructions
Complete the following steps to support the Global Super Store in performing data analytics in Tableau.


Step 1: Prepare the data set for analysis
In this first part of the task, you need to connect to the Global Super Store data set, then prepare it for data analysis by making sure that all fields including the Order date and the Ship date contain the correct data types.

Step 2: Create a map chart
Global Super Store want to investigate their business performance in Africa. Create a map chart that shows sales in different countries in Africa. The map should show the sales in proportional sizes. If you rollover a country, you should be able to see the country name, quantity sold, and sales figure as shown below. 


Step 3: Create a bar chart
Global Super Store want to check the profits made in each country in Africa. However, they are only interested in data from countries where they have made at least $500 in profit. 

To help them identify this data, create a bar chart in Tableau called Profits in Africa. When you rollover a bar, you should be able to see the name of the country, the profits and the shipping cost, as shown below. 

Next, develop a dashboard that includes the Sales in Africa map (created in the second part of the task), and the new worksheet Profits in Africa as shown below.


Finally, make the dashboard interactive. When you click on a specific country in the map (such as Cote d'Ivoire) the information related to that country must be displayed in the bar chart.


Conclusion
In this exercise you performed data analysis in Tableau. You prepared the Global Super Store data for data analysis, analyzed the data with relevant charts, and created an interactive dashboard.

```
There are two main objectives in this activity:
Working with single row, multiple row and correlated subqueries.

Using the comparison operators and the ALL and NOT EXISTS operators with subqueries.


Exercise Instructions
Please attempt the following tasks.

Task 1: Write a SQL SELECT query to find all bookings that are due after the booking of the guest ‘Vanessa McCarthy’.

The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the orders tables correctly). 


Task 2: Write a SQL SELECT query to find the menu items that are more expensive than all the 'Starters' and 'Desserts' menu item types.

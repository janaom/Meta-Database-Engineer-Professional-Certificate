Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need to have the Mangata and Gallo database so that you can create the 'Staffâ€™ table inside it. If you don't have this database, complete the following steps to create it.

1: Create database
```
CREATE DATABASE Mangata_Gallo;
```
2: Use database
```
 USE Mangata_Gallo;
```

This activity has two main objectives:
Create the 'Staff' table in Mangata and Gallo database.

Make the necessary changes to the table structure.
